# d-tools
The aim of this project is to tackle a problem of "too long commands" in docker.
It is a set of useful commands to deal with docker / docker-compose projects in a laconic way.

## How to install

Make it a git-submodule to your project. 

```
TODO how?
```

Add scripts to the PATH variable to call it from any location.

## How to use

**TODO** add asciicast

### dcleanup

Use it to remove all dangling images and volumes. It may save a lot of your HD.
